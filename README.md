# Socket-Programming

Implemented this project to understand HTTP requests and responses using TCP socket connections. Created a multithreaded server which would serve HTTP GET messages by either a Client or a Browser. If the requested file is found on the server, that file will be returned to the client or a 404 file not found message would be displayed on the browser or the client.
